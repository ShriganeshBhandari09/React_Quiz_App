# Programming Quiz App

## Project Description

This is a web-based quiz application focused on programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React. The app uses React Js, Redux-Saga, and Dummy JSON Server to present multiple-choice questions, calculate scores, and store the user’s progress and scores in the Dummy JSON Server. The quiz is an interactive way for users to test and improve their knowledge of programming fundamentals.

## Features

- **Quiz Questions:** Multiple-choice questions covering topics in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Score Tracking:** Calculates and displays the user’s score at the end of each quiz.
- **Data Persistence:** Stores user progress and scores in the Dummy JSON Server so they can view their past performance.
- **Responsive Design:** Adaptable to various screen sizes for an optimal experience on any device.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Core library for building the user interface and managing application state.
- **Redux-Saga:** Middleware for handling side effects and managing asynchronous actions.
- **CSS3:** Styling, including responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Core logic for quiz functionality, including question navigation, score calculation, and data persistence.
- **Dummy JSON Server:** To save quiz results and user progress on a simulated backend.
